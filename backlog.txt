Things I want to add:
-logging
-java docs
-unit tests
-mobile friendly email?


DONE:
-confirmation email upon subscription
-Update JSP UI
-Test Email Sending + Format
-mocking (run any piece locally without server instance)
-Patch Notes in email
-IE UI support (not going to do anything here. App functions in IE and looks as intended with IE11)
