Things I want to add:
-Update JSP UI
-unit tests


Optimization Options:
-Can remove DB call to store last JSON and only used cached version (this may cause a missed email during application updates)


DONE:
-Test Email Sending + Format
-mocking (run any piece locally without server instance)
-Patch Notes in email
