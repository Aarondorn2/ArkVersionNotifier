Things I want to add:
-logging
-java docs
-unit tests
-mobile friendly email?
-sendmail?
		<dependency>
			<groupId>com.sendgrid</groupId>
			<artifactId>sendgrid-java</artifactId>
			<version>2.2.2</version>
		</dependency>


DONE:
-confirmation email upon subscription
-Update JSP UI
-Test Email Sending + Format
-mocking (run any piece locally without server instance)
-Patch Notes in email
-IE UI support (not going to do anything here. App functions in IE and looks as intended with IE11)
