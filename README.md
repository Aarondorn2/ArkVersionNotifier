Ark Version Notifier
=============================

This project is designed to notify subscribers when an update is available for the game 'Ark: Survival Evolved'.  It is written in Java and designed to run on Google App Engine.  It has a UI to allow users to subscribe or unsubscribe from various email options including when a new version is announced, the ETA changes, and/or the version is released.  The app periodically polls an API provided by http://Ark.Bar to get information regarding the version / upcoming version of the game.

I've been doing Java for a while, but this is my first for many things in the project including: Google App Engine, App Engine Datastore (or any NoSQL-type datastore), Maven, GitHub, and Quartz (job scheduling for executing code at set intervals).
